Description: Performs analysis of various genetic parameters like genotypic and phenotypic coefficient of variance, heritability, genetic advance, genetic advance as a percentage of mean. The package also has functions for genotypic and phenotypic covariance, correlation and path analysis. Dataset has been added to facilitate example.
